The intent of this small simple project is to create a API REST using Java from scratch. There are no other tools or libraery involved.
It was a good experience to understande how things are done under the hood, not that I manage to implement things in a professional way such as Spring Boot Devs, but it work at least.

Basically what's happening is the program reads request data interpreting and processing the operation and the data sent. The Java resources I used are Server Socket to instantiate server, BufferedReader to read request data and PrintWriter to write the response.

The API is a simple User CRUD. I didn't spend a lot of time validating data and making it a clean API. The goal here was just to make it work without any tools.
